# CashScraper

CashScraper is a basic full stack application that web scrapes finance-related articles from an external website using Cheerio, stores them into MongoDB, and then displays the information with the help of Mongoose to the user.

### Skills Learned

I learned many things while doing this project with the support of my wife
who is also a very talented programmer and Stack Overflow. Here are some things
I learned on the fly:

- MongoDB (No SQL Database)
- Mongoose (MongoDB ORM)
- Cheerio (for Web Scraping)

### Comments

At it's basic level, this application is a web scraper of articles. The biggest challenge
was trying to join an additional collection and allowing the user to write or delete notes from individual articles. Given more time, I would've liked to have given the user a chance to save
each starred article to a seperate page. A majority of my time this week was spent rebuilding my portfolio and learning React. This is one project I see myself going back to finishing post-graduation because I really do like working with MongoDB.
